## Phase 3: Grid Resizing Progress

### Task 1: Create grid-divider component for drag handles - COMPLETE

Implemented the grid-divider component with the following:

- Created `src/components/grid-divider.ts` with Lit web component
- GridDivider class has `orientation` property ('horizontal' | 'vertical') and `index` property
- Styled as thin 4px bar with dark blue (#0f3460) background, highlight on hover (#4a90d9)
- Cursor styles: `col-resize` for vertical, `row-resize` for horizontal dividers
- Dispatches `divider-drag-start` custom event on mousedown with orientation, index, and start coordinates
- Has `setDragging()` method for visual feedback control

Updated `src/components/iframe-grid.ts`:

- Integrated grid-divider into the grid layout
- Modified grid template to include 4px divider tracks between cells (e.g., "1fr 4px 2fr" instead of "1fr 2fr")
- Renders vertical dividers between columns (n-1 dividers for n columns)
- Renders horizontal dividers between rows (n-1 dividers for n rows)
- Dividers span the full height/width of the grid appropriately

Added comprehensive tests in `src/components/grid-divider.test.ts`:
- Tests for orientation, index properties
- Tests for cursor styles per orientation
- Tests for divider-drag-start event dispatch
- Tests for dragging visual state

Updated existing tests in `src/components/iframe-grid.test.ts`:
- Updated grid template tests to expect divider track format
- Added tests for vertical/horizontal divider rendering
- Added test for 1x1 grid (no dividers)
- Added test for divider index assignment

All 34 tests passing.
