## Phase 7: Apply dark mode styling throughout - COMPLETE

Created centralized theme system:
- Added src/styles/theme.ts with CSS variables for the dark theme palette
- Defined color constants: background (#1a1a2e), surface (#16213e), border (#0f3460), accent (#e94560), text colors, etc.
- Created themeStyles (Lit CSS), globalThemeStyles (raw CSS string), and applyGlobalTheme() function
- Integrated theme into dashboard-app.ts - applies global theme on load, uses CSS variables with fallbacks
- All components already use consistent dark colors; theme.ts now provides single source of truth

Note: The existing codebase already had consistent dark styling throughout all components. This change centralizes the color palette definition for easier maintenance and potential future theming.

## Phase 7: Write open-wc unit tests for storage-service - COMPLETE

Verified that comprehensive unit tests for StorageService already exist in src/services/storage-service.test.ts:
- Test save writes to localStorage (lines 18-58)
- Test load retrieves from localStorage (lines 60-83)
- Test handles missing data gracefully - returns null when no state saved (line 61-63)
- Test handles corrupted data gracefully - tests for invalid JSON, missing iframes, invalid grid config, wrong ratio lengths, negative positions, zero/negative/non-numeric ratios (lines 85-161)
- Mock localStorage for isolation - uses custom test key with beforeEach/afterEach cleanup
- Complex state tests including 2x2 grid with multiple iframes (lines 194-215)

Tests: 287 passed, 0 failed
Typecheck: Pass
