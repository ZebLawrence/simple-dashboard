## Phase 7: Apply dark mode styling throughout - COMPLETE

Created centralized theme system:
- Added src/styles/theme.ts with CSS variables for the dark theme palette
- Defined color constants: background (#1a1a2e), surface (#16213e), border (#0f3460), accent (#e94560), text colors, etc.
- Created themeStyles (Lit CSS), globalThemeStyles (raw CSS string), and applyGlobalTheme() function
- Integrated theme into dashboard-app.ts - applies global theme on load, uses CSS variables with fallbacks
- All components already use consistent dark colors; theme.ts now provides single source of truth

Note: The existing codebase already had consistent dark styling throughout all components. This change centralizes the color palette definition for easier maintenance and potential future theming.
