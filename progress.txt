## Phase 6, Task 1: Create storage-service for localStorage operations

Completed: 2026-01-24

### What was done:
- Created `src/services/storage-service.ts` with a `StorageService` class
- Implemented `save(state: WorkspaceState): boolean` method with quota error handling
- Implemented `load(): WorkspaceState | null` method with validation
- Implemented `clear()` method
- Added comprehensive validation for WorkspaceState, IframeConfig, and GridConfig
- Handles corrupted data gracefully (clears storage and returns null)
- Uses consistent localStorage key: `dashboard-workspace-state`

### Tests:
- Created `src/services/storage-service.test.ts` with 17 test cases covering:
  - Saving and loading valid workspace states
  - Handling invalid JSON
  - Handling missing or malformed data structures
  - Validating iframe configs and grid configs
  - Edge cases like empty arrays, negative values, wrong ratio lengths

### Configuration change:
- Updated `web-test-runner.config.js` to use `concurrency: 1` to fix localStorage race conditions between parallel tests

### Notes for next person:
- The storage service is now ready to be integrated with DashboardApp
- Next task should be "Implement save workspace state" which will wire up the service
- The StorageService exports both a class and a default instance (`storageService`)

## Phase 6, Task 2: Implement save workspace state

Completed: 2026-01-24

### What was done:
- Added `getWorkspaceState()` method to DashboardApp that returns a WorkspaceState object
- Added `saveState()` method to DashboardApp that saves state via storageService
- Imported `storageService` and `WorkspaceState` type in dashboard-app.ts
- Added 14 new tests for save workspace state functionality covering:
  - Serializing iframes array to JSON
  - Serializing grid config to JSON
  - Combining into WorkspaceState object
  - Writing to localStorage
  - Verifying data persists in browser storage
  - Saving includes iframe IDs, URLs, and positions
  - Saving includes columnRatios and rowRatios
  - Saving updated state after adding/removing iframes

### Tests:
- All 257 tests pass (including 14 new tests for save workspace state)
- Note: There's a puppeteer "detached frame" error during test cleanup that's unrelated to actual test failures - it's an infrastructure issue with iframe-heavy tests

### Notes for next person:
- The `saveState()` method is now available but not automatically called
- Next task should be "Implement auto-save on changes" which will call saveState() after each state change
- Alternatively, "Implement load workspace state" can be done to restore state on app init

## Phase 6, Task 4: Implement load workspace state

Completed: 2026-01-24

### What was done:
- Added `loadState()` method to DashboardApp that reads from localStorage via storageService
- Added `connectedCallback()` override to call `loadState()` on app initialization
- The method applies loaded iframes and grid config to component state
- Returns true if state was loaded, false if no saved state or invalid data
- Validation is handled by StorageService (already implemented in Task 1)

### Tests:
- Added 9 new tests for load workspace state functionality covering:
  - Reading from localStorage on app init
  - Parsing JSON to WorkspaceState
  - Applying loaded iframes to grid
  - Applying loaded grid ratios
  - Restoring previous session from localStorage
  - loadState returns true when state is loaded
  - loadState returns false when no saved state exists
  - Using default state when localStorage is empty
  - Rendering loaded iframes in the grid component
- All 266 tests pass

### Notes for next person:
- Load state is automatically called on app initialization via connectedCallback
- The app will restore the previous session if localStorage has saved state
- If no saved state exists, the app uses its default state (4 iframes in 2x2 grid)
- Next tasks: "Implement auto-save on changes" or "Handle empty/first-load state" or "Handle corrupted storage data"

## Phase 6, Task 3: Implement auto-save on changes

Completed: 2026-01-24

### What was done:
- Added event listeners in DashboardApp render for `@url-changed` and `@grid-drag-complete`
- Added `saveState()` call after adding iframe in `_handleAddIframe`
- Added `saveState()` call after removing iframe in `_handleRemoveIframe`
- Added `_handleUrlChanged` method to update iframe URL in state and call `saveState()`
- Added `_handleGridDragComplete` method to update grid ratios and call `saveState()`
- Grid resizing is debounced by using `grid-drag-complete` event (fires once at end of drag) instead of `ratio-change` (fires continuously during drag)

### Tests:
- Added 8 new tests for auto-save functionality covering:
  - Calls save after adding iframe
  - Calls save after removing iframe
  - Calls save after editing iframe URL
  - Updates iframe URL in state after url-changed event
  - Calls save after resizing grid
  - Updates grid ratios in state after grid-drag-complete event
  - Debounces rapid changes during drag by using grid-drag-complete
  - Verifies state is saved after each action type
- All 274 tests pass

### Notes for next person:
- Auto-save is now fully implemented - state is persisted after every user action
- The `url-changed` event was already being dispatched by `iframe-panel` component
- The `grid-drag-complete` event was already being dispatched by `iframe-grid` component
- Next tasks: "Handle empty/first-load state" or "Handle corrupted storage data"
