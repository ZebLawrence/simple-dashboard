## Phase 6, Task 1: Create storage-service for localStorage operations

Completed: 2026-01-24

### What was done:
- Created `src/services/storage-service.ts` with a `StorageService` class
- Implemented `save(state: WorkspaceState): boolean` method with quota error handling
- Implemented `load(): WorkspaceState | null` method with validation
- Implemented `clear()` method
- Added comprehensive validation for WorkspaceState, IframeConfig, and GridConfig
- Handles corrupted data gracefully (clears storage and returns null)
- Uses consistent localStorage key: `dashboard-workspace-state`

### Tests:
- Created `src/services/storage-service.test.ts` with 17 test cases covering:
  - Saving and loading valid workspace states
  - Handling invalid JSON
  - Handling missing or malformed data structures
  - Validating iframe configs and grid configs
  - Edge cases like empty arrays, negative values, wrong ratio lengths

### Configuration change:
- Updated `web-test-runner.config.js` to use `concurrency: 1` to fix localStorage race conditions between parallel tests

### Notes for next person:
- The storage service is now ready to be integrated with DashboardApp
- Next task should be "Implement save workspace state" which will wire up the service
- The StorageService exports both a class and a default instance (`storageService`)
