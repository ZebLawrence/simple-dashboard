### Phase 5 Task 1: Implement hover detection on iframe-panel - COMPLETE

Implemented proper hover detection with JavaScript state management instead of pure CSS hover:

Updated `src/components/iframe-panel.ts`:
- Added `_isHovered` state property to track hover state
- Added `_handleMouseEnter()` method to set hover state to true
- Added `_handleMouseLeave()` method to set hover state to false
- Added `isHovered` getter for external access to hover state
- Added mouseenter/mouseleave event listeners to iframe-container
- Added `.hover-overlay` div for pointer event handling over iframe
- Changed toolbar visibility from CSS `:hover` to `.visible` class based on state
- When hovered, overlay captures pointer events so mouseleave fires correctly
- Toolbar now uses `pointer-events: none` by default, `auto` when visible

Added 8 tests to `src/components/iframe-panel.test.ts`:
- Test for isHovered is false by default
- Test for setting isHovered to true on mouseenter
- Test for setting isHovered to false on mouseleave
- Test for adding hovered class to container on mouseenter
- Test for removing hovered class from container on mouseleave
- Test for rendering hover overlay for pointer event handling
- Test for toolbar becomes visible when hovered
- Test for toolbar hides when hover ends

All 167 tests passing.

### Phase 5 Task 2: Create toolbar overlay UI - COMPLETE

Updated toolbar styling in `src/components/iframe-panel.ts`:
- Added semi-transparent dark background (rgba(15, 52, 96, 0.85))
- Toolbar now spans full width at top of panel (left: 0, right: 0)
- Increased padding to 8px for better visual appearance
- Added justify-content: flex-end to keep close button on right side
- Smooth fade-in transition was already in place (opacity 0.2s ease)

Added 2 tests to `src/components/iframe-panel.test.ts`:
- Test for toolbar having semi-transparent dark background
- Test for toolbar spanning full width at top of panel (position absolute, top/left/right: 0)

All 169 tests passing.
